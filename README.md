Sun 3 bootrom project

Beginning with the old sun sources in SS3.2, hack the
sources and put a Makefile together to build a rom image
using the m68k gcc cross compiler and assembler on an
x86 linux host.

I am going to begin targetting the Sun 3/160 since the sources
support that (as CARERRA) and because I have a 3/160 to test with.
