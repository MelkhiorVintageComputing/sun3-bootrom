# ===================================
# assym.h contains assembler defns of structure members.  It's made by
# genassym.c, which just printf's their values.  make depend keeps it all OK.
# structconst.h contains hex values of constant structs like page map entries.
# This hack is used to get around C's refusal to initialize local structs
# and inability to define structure constants.
